1. CAPITALIZE

Should consider about making second String also an upper case, because it can be as an example "surname" = "Edgar A" or name of two String = "Sant Paulo"   


2. CONTAINS

Would be usefull to have  such an apportunity also with integers. We could define from integer what gender is or a birth of the person

3. TO_LIST

According to the script it should take as a defaul comma(,) and change it, if it is another delimeter. Testing failed.


4. STARTS_WITH  AND END_WITH

Would be nice to find not only one symbol but as many as you write symbols example word "computer" to find "ter" and "com"


5. IS_EMPTY 

When we write quotes and put a space " " I cant consider it is an emptyness. We define it as a symbol. I think it doesnt suppose to be like this.

6. LIST_TO_STRING

in the desciption we have that joiner by default should be comma (,) as a result. When we run a test it is showing a mistake. Example in the test ["Lesson", "1"], "","Lesson, 1"
